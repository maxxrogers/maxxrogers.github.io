												<h2>My Family</h2>
												<p>Brief insight into my family background and my life growing up</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/WholeFamily.JPG" alt="" /></span>

											<p>On this webpage, you will gain a glimpse into my family heritage, which has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. Also learning about my youth, from growing up surrounded by creativity and hands-on projects with my grandpa, to the early passions that shaped my career path. I share insights into my parents' work as educators and how their dedication influenced my own teaching journey. Additionally, I dive into my sporting history, reflecting on how my involvement in soccer, cricket, AFL and golf has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. This page offers a deeper understanding of the key experiences and values that have guided me throughout my life.</p>

											<h3>My Family Heritage</h3>
											<p>My family heritage is a blend of English and German roots, which has instilled in me a strong sense of tradition and resilience. My parents, both dedicated educators, have been influential in my lifeâ€”one serving as a principal and the other as a head teacher. Growing up in a small family with just two cousins and no siblings, I've cherished the close relationships I have with my grandparents, who have played a significant role in my upbringing. Despite our small size, the bonds within my family are strong, providing me with a solid foundation of support and inspiration.</p>

											<h3>My Youth</h3>
											<p>Sport has played a pivotal role in shaping the person I am today. My experiences in playing representative AFL for the GWS Giants, as well as competing at high levels in cricket and soccer, have taught me invaluable lessons in discipline, teamwork, and resilience. Each sport has challenged me to push my limits, both physically and mentally, and has instilled a strong work ethic and determination to succeed. Now, as I participate in golf competitions, I continue to refine these qualities, learning the importance of patience and focus. Through sport, I've developed a well-rounded perspective on life, understanding the significance of perseverance, leadership, and maintaining a balanced mindset, all of which I carry with me in every aspect of my life.</p>
