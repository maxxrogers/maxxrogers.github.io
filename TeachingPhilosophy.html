												<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
												<p>Information below about the type of teacher I wish to become</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Teaching.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that education is a dynamic and transformative process. I strive to create a learning environment that is inclusive, engaging, and responsive to the diverse needs of my students. I see teaching as an opportunity to inspire curiosity, foster critical thinking, and empower students to take ownership of their learning. By combining hands-on experiences with theoretical knowledge, I aim to cultivate a classroom where students feel valued, motivated, and equipped to face the challenges of the future. My goal is to not only impart knowledge but also to instill a lifelong love for learning.

											</p>

											<h3>My Inspiration</h3>
											<p>My inspiration to pursue teaching stems from the deep-rooted influence of my parents, both of whom are dedicated educators. Watching their passion for teaching and their commitment to their students profoundly shaped my own desire to make a difference in the lives of others. Additionally, my grandpa and I spent countless hours building timber projects together, instilling in me a love for hands-on work and the joy of creating something from scratch. My passion for cooking, which blossomed at a young age, further fueled my interest in teaching practical subjects. These experiences combined to inspire me to follow in my parents' footsteps and share my love for learning and creativity with future generations.</p>

											<h3>Teaching Philosophy Within Classroom</h3>
											<p>In my classroom, I draw on a variety of teaching philosophies to create a well-rounded and effective learning environment. Constructivism plays a central role, where I encourage students to build their own understanding through hands-on activities and collaborative projects. I also incorporate elements of experiential learning, allowing students to learn by doing, which is especially effective in practical subjects like woodwork and cooking. Differentiated instruction is another key philosophy, as I recognize the diverse needs of my students and adapt my teaching methods to meet them where they are. Additionally, I believe in the importance of fostering a growth mindset, helping students see challenges as opportunities for growth and encouraging resilience in their learning journey. By blending these approaches, I aim to create a dynamic and supportive classroom where every student can thrive.







											</p>
											<h3>The teacher I wish to become</h3>
											<p>As a teacher, I aspire to embody the qualities of compassion, patience, inspiration, and calmness. I want to be the kind of educator who truly understands and supports my students, recognizing their unique challenges and celebrating their successes. My goal is to create a nurturing environment where students feel safe to express themselves and take risks in their learning. Patience will be at the heart of my teaching, as I guide each student at their own pace, ensuring they have the time and space to grow. I also aim to be a source of inspiration, sparking curiosity and a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom. Finally, I strive to maintain a calm and steady presence, providing stability and reassurance to my students, no matter the challenges we may face together.
